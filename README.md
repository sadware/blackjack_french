# blackjack_french :

A blackjack game I created for school. Please note that most of the text is in French due to it being a school project.

# Features I'll add in time when I get back to the project : 
  1. Possibility to play mutliple games and store the money you have each time.
  2. Split and Insurance functions
  3. If I create other card games in python, I might add them in the file and the play() function will let you choose which game you want to play
